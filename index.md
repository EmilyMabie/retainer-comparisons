# Retainer Comparisons

## A website designed to compare the prices of clear orthodontic retainers from popular manufacturers, in order to save the consumer money.

This website was designed and executed using HTML and CSS.



When I was first in the market for a new retainer, I had just finished spending thousands of dollars to straighten my teeth. I wanted to find the best deal I could to keep them in tip-top shape: that was the impetus for this project.

At the time of publication, Remi's subscription model was the most economical for repeat customers. This website will be updated with JavaScript and more in the days to come.
